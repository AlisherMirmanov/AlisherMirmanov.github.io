            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alisher, and I am passionate about mathematics, specifically interested in Analysis,  Probability Theory, Statistical Inference, Topology, and Stochastic Calculus. I graduated from Kings College in 2024 with a BSc Mathematics degree and will study Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London for my master's program.Â I am enthusiastic about opportunities that will allow me to combine my mathematical skills in a creative setting, along with implementing data and statistics to create a meaningful impact in the world.</p>

                <h3>Undergraduate thesis: Acceleration in Optimization: Perspective from Geometry and Classical Physics</h3>
                <p>This project serves as a review of physical and geometrical interpretations of a popular modern optimization technique, Nesterov Gradient Descent (NGD). To better understand its accelerated convergence rate, the continuous time limit of the algorithm is derived and the system is analyzed under the calculus of variation framework.
                    To offer insights into Nesterov optimization method in a non-Euclidean setting, the extension of all these results in a manifold setting is studied.  <a href="https://alishermirmanov.github.io/Disseration/">View on GitHub</a></p>

                <h3>Time Series Analysis of Kazakhstan Energy data using ARIMA model and methods from topology</h3>
                <p>In this project, the Renewable Energy proportion in Kazakhstan is modeled using the ARIMA time-series model, and the data is forecasted for 10 years. Further, using the time delay embedding technique, methods from Algebraic Topology, namely persistence homology, are used in an unusual setting (not in clustering tasks) to analyze the geometry of data to reveal additional structure underlying time series.  <a href=" https://alishermirmanov.github.io/Personal-Projects-/">View on GitHub</a></p>
