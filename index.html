            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alisher, and I am passionate about mathematics, specifically interested in Analysis,  Probability Theory, Data and Statistics. I graduated from Kings College in 2024 with a BSc Mathematics degree and recently finished my studies at Imperial College London(MSc Pure Mathematics). I am enthusiastic about opportunities that will allow me to combine my mathematical skills with creativity in a real worls setting. I am now seeking opportunities in quantitative research, data science, or applied statistics—where I can apply my mathematical training to drive meaningful insight.</p>

                <h3>Graduate Thesis: Higher Order Approximation of Non - Linear SPDE's with Additive Space-Time Noise</h3>
                <p>This project reviews convergence rates of higher-order numerical schemes for nonlinear reaction–diffusion SPDEs with additive space–time white noise on the 1-D torus. It establishes functional bounds for two types of nonlinearities: (i) globally bounded functions with bounded derivatives and (ii) polynomially growing functions under a one-sided Lipschitz condition. The analysis relies on two key theoretical tools: the Stochastic Sewing Lemma and Littlewood–Paley/Besov-space methods.<a href="https://github.com/AlisherMirmanov/MSc-Thesis---Higher-Order-Approximation-of-non-linear-SPDE-s">View on GitHub</a></p>

                <h3>Undergraduate Thesis: Acceleration in Optimization: Perspective from Geometry and Classical Physics</h3>
                <p>This project serves as a review of physical and geometrical interpretations of a popular modern optimization technique, Nesterov Gradient Descent (NGD). To better understand its accelerated convergence rate, the continuous time limit of the algorithm is derived and the system is analyzed under the calculus of variation framework.
                    To offer insights into Nesterov optimization method in a non-Euclidean setting, the extension of all these results in a manifold setting is studied.  <a href="https://github.com/AlisherMirmanov/Disseration">View on GitHub</a></p>

                <h3>Trading Project : Pairs Trading in Cryptocurrency Markets</h3>
                <p>Reimplemented a popular pairs trading strategy on cryptocurrency spot market. Used Engle–Granger cointegration test and modeled spread with Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, followed by Z-score based signal generation for trade entry and exit. The backtest is done on spot markets, and achieved an annualized Sharpe ratio of 4.44 and a 62.2% annual return. Currently implemented the strategy on TestNet on USDT-margianted perpetual futures.<a href="https://github.com/AlisherMirmanov/Pairs-Trading-on-Crypto-Spots">View on GitHub</a> </p>

                <h3>Time Series analysis using methods from Algebraic Topology</h3>
                <p>In this project, the Renewable Energy proportion in Kazakhstan is modeled using the ARIMA time-series model, and the data is forecasted for 10 years. Further, using the time delay embedding technique, methods from Algebraic Topology, namely persistence homology, are used in an unusual setting (not in clustering tasks) to analyze the geometry of data to reveal additional structure underlying time series.  <a href="  https://github.com/AlisherMirmanov/Personal-Projects-/tree/main">View on GitHub</a></p>
